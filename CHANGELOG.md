- Offer Astra, Opus 5.5, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, and GLM 5.3 when available on the connected account.
- Save model changes before starting the next assistant request.

## v1.6.23

- Add a canvas assistant for drafting scenes, editing nodes, connecting references, and proposing image or video generation for confirmation.
- Keep assistant conversations and canvas changes recoverable across restarts, with conflict checks and per-turn undo.
- Let external agents connect through the bundled CLI and MCP using revocable read-only or read-write access.
- Share canvas operations and generation delivery across manual editing and agents, preserving original tasks during recovery.
- Unify media rendering and workspace backup paths while retaining existing projects, assets, and tasks.

## v1.6.22

- Add a director workbench for staging objects, cameras, motion paths, and shot previews.
- Keep director references and exported previews attached to the correct scene when switching or closing the workbench.
- Preserve shot prompts, camera motion, and independent paths when editing or duplicating scenes.
- Restore the canvas archive import entry in the project library.

## v1.6.21

- Keep copied media nodes on the canvas when regenerating them, including changing a copied video's resolution.
- Upload local Seedance reference media before generation, supporting large files and validating media limits before submission.
- Preserve reference dimensions and use the same media preparation path for built-in and protocol-based video generation.

## v1.6.20

- Keep media file extensions when saving or renaming downloads in the Windows file dialog, while preserving overwrite confirmation and cancellation.
- Use the actual media format for asset-library downloads, including MOV, SVG, WAV and M4A.

## v1.6.19

- Explain account quota shortages with actionable balance, token and plan guidance.
- Distinguish completed videos that could not be saved from generation failures, directing users to recover the original result without paying again.
- Preserve structured provider errors and request IDs through video creation, polling and manual result recovery.

## v1.6.18

- Continue polling the original video task after Windows socket resets or connection aborts instead of failing immediately.

- Add “取回结果” to failed video task details on the canvas and in desktop task history; query and download the original result without creating another paid generation.
- Treat lost submission receipts as unconfirmed instead of silently resubmitting; keep explicit rate limits and pre-dispatch rejections retryable.
- Show readable, sanitized task log summaries and prevent late task detail responses from reopening or replacing a different task.

## v1.6.15

- Preserve specific generation errors, request IDs, timings and bounded request history in copied diagnostics, including after reopening a task.
- Distinguish local input and response-size limits, provider failures, and errors while saving or applying generated results.
- Include task image settings, reference counts and limits without copying prompts, credentials or media addresses; preserve request evidence during background polling and clear it when retrying.

## v1.6.14

- Keep canvas task details up to date with the desktop backend while a task is running, including progress, logs and start/completion times.
- Stop detail polling after completion and cancel pending reads when closing or switching tasks; show a retry notice when details cannot be refreshed.

## v1.6.13

- Use the configured Windows/macOS system proxy for optional depth-component downloads, matching the desktop updater and preserving explicit environment proxy/bypass settings.
- Include Windows x64 depth-video processing from v1.6.12 with signed optional runtimes. CPU inference is tested; NVIDIA CUDA support is a community testing preview with a one-time CPU fallback for device failures. First use downloads components, and CPU processing can be slow and memory intensive.
- Expand the director workspace with scene controls, camera following, aspect frames, screenshots and panorama generation history.
- Preserve director scene covers and task recovery context, and improve canvas crop and trim controls at low zoom.
- Check for desktop updates periodically and support downloading and installing from one action while saving work first.
- Prevent late uploads and screenshots from overwriting reopened director scenes; drain panorama result writers before switching workspaces.
- Stamp director cover and output edits before persistence so refreshed canvases retain their previews.
- Install the matching Chromium browser in CI and tolerate subpixel rounding in model-picker layout checks.

## v1.6.12

- Add Windows x64 depth-video processing with the fixed Small model, signed optional CPU/CUDA runtimes, resumable verified downloads, and process-tree cancellation.
- Validate CUDA with a real model probe and fall back once to CPU for device failures. CUDA hardware support is a community testing preview; CPU inference has been tested on Windows with 2-second and 15-second clips.
- Fix Windows PowerShell 5.1 runtime-builder encoding and align the worker's video-duration limit with the app.
- Serialize component installation and stop download verification and extraction when cancelled.
- First use downloads optional components; CPU processing can be slow and memory intensive. Apple Silicon Mac processing remains unchanged.

## v1.6.11

- Fix local reference images being rejected before submitting Wan 3.0 video tasks through BeefAPI.
- Share verified enterprise video contracts across the model catalog, reference validation, and request preparation; preserve explicit protocols for other models.
- Reject unsupported reference types and counts before submission, and retain actionable media guidance in task history.
- Honor installed protocol media declarations and include the shared contracts in container builds.

## v1.6.10

- Check reference-video frame rates on WhatsToken material-conversion routes, including ordinary, fragmented and mixed MP4 files.
- Explain frame-rate, unsupported-codec and asset-access errors with actionable guidance that survives task history reloads.
- Preserve authentication errors and request identifiers when formatting media errors.

## v1.6.9

- Fix built-in BeefAPI Seedance profiles selecting a package name instead of the installed video provider ID, which caused false "interface not installed" failures before submission.
- Repair existing enterprise profiles automatically and accept previously saved OpenAI Videos protocol aliases without bypassing disabled plugins.
- Verify imported and restored Seedance profiles against the shipped provider catalog and test legacy aliases through the installed plugin runtime.

## v1.6.8

- Read missing reference-video dimensions even when duration is already known, and reject unreadable or out-of-range video before submission.
- Validate local and inline video dimensions from the actual file instead of trusting stale metadata.
- Explain pixel-limit failures with the affected reference, actual dimensions and allowed range.

## v1.6.7

- Ask for confirmation before paid Seedance 2.0 standard and 2.5 reference-video generation on affected channels where the requested aspect ratio may not be honored.
- Show frame, edit and extension settings that follow the source media, and explain first-frame compatibility errors with actionable guidance.
- Preserve generated videos and show a notice when their measured aspect ratio differs from the submitted request.

## v1.6.6

- Preserve structured provider error codes when polling Seedance tasks, so temporary route outages do not ask users to change model settings.

## v1.6.5

- Preserve explicit Seedance 2.5 reference/edit/extend task intent in provider requests.
- Recognize temporary model route unavailability as an actionable provider error.

## v1.6.4

- Restore Seedance image, video and audio references for built-in BeefAPI models after catalog import and configuration reload.
- Migrate the old built-in zero-reference profile while preserving unrelated custom limits, and align Seedance submission with the Videos API.
- Recognize Seedance capabilities for OpenAI Videos model profiles in both frontend and backend validation.

## v1.6.3

- Preserve explicit first/last-frame roles and adaptive aspect ratios for Seedance 2.5, including official model aliases and BeefAPI Enterprise requests.
- Keep reference generation distinct from frame, edit and extension constraints; retain explicitly selected reference and extension modes.
- Add a supported-mode selector to the professional video canvas and explain when output parameters follow input media.
- Explain nested TaskTypeConstraint failures with actionable guidance and retain the same message and diagnostic IDs after task reload.

## v1.6.2

- Retire the unfinished built-in Agent product surface: the canvas dock, creation entry, home capability card, Agent query parameters, Agent settings and the `/agent/*` API are no longer reachable, so partially working Agent flows can no longer be entered by mistake.
- Enforce the retirement at the product boundary: generic task creation, task retry and the task worker refuse `cloud_agent`, `cloud_agent_step` and `agent_memory_compact` work instead of executing it as an ordinary paid text generation, and the periodic Agent memory compaction no longer runs in the background.
- Keep historical Agent runs, profiles, memories and tasks in place with no destructive migration.
- Manual creation and generation keep their existing authorization, quoting, approval, idempotency and cancellation behaviour on the canvas and in the creation workspace; canvas editing and connections, projects, assets, local storage, model channels, the built-in BeefAPI connection and the v1.6.0 depth workflow are unchanged. The retired Agent approval and memory endpoints are removed together with the rest of `/agent/*`.
- Remove the unused local `AgentPort` wiring, the test-only `generation.Engine`/`Deps` wrapper that had no production caller, and the unreferenced experimental `cmd/mcp` stdio entry.
- Simplify the core CI gates to the checks that guard the local product surface.
## v1.6.1

- Explain input and output moderation failures by text, image, video and audio, including copyright, privacy and counterfeit-content restrictions.
- Preserve specific failure guidance and request IDs when reloading task history; avoid attributing general moderation failures to real-person references.
- Distinguish upstream billing problems, configured usage limits, concurrency limits and model permissions, including errors wrapped in generic request codes.
- Keep uncertain submissions and unchanged moderation failures from automatically generating another request.

## v1.6.0

- Add depth action capture to the canvas video-processing menu on Apple Silicon Macs, with an optional local runtime and separately cached Small model weights.
- Download and verify depth components from the BeefTV release, with a Hugging Face fallback for model weights and visible task progress.
- Keep video first-frame posters visible until hover playback presents a decoded frame, preventing black flashes when playback starts or stops.
- Preserve current generation, reference-media, desktop-update, and task-retry contracts while integrating the new workflow.

## v1.5.9

- Validate reference image dimensions, aspect ratios, file sizes and audio/video duration using each model's configured capabilities before submitting.
- Preserve supported reference counts, resolutions and durations instead of silently dropping media or downgrading requested settings.
- Support local and inline reference audio for BeefAPI and native Ark channels, while retaining provider-specific audio-only rules.
- Show actionable reference conversion and request-size errors in both canvas nodes and task history, with safe diagnostics and no unsafe unchanged retries.

## v1.5.8

- Add a persistent light/dark switch to the workspace sidebar, with matching home, asset library, menus and settings surfaces.
- Restore canvas appearance controls with light, dark and custom modes; keep each canvas appearance independent from the workspace theme.
- New canvases follow the workspace theme unless an explicit default appearance is saved.

## v1.5.7

- Desktop update checks and downloads now use Cloudflare-hosted files, preserving signed manifests and package integrity verification.
- Publish immutable platform packages before switching the update feed, with verified downloads and protection against incomplete or older releases.

## v1.5.6

- Validate Seedance reference audio/video duration before submission and preserve duration metadata for character voice samples.
- Explain material conversion failures with actionable duration limits and retain request identifiers for support.
- Keep existing task polling available and prevent unsafe resubmission while provider acceptance is uncertain.

## v1.5.5

- Desktop update checks and downloads now use the current user's static HTTP/HTTPS system proxy on macOS and Windows when no explicit environment proxy is configured.
- Keep a manual update check in the sidebar and show a retry action when checking fails, instead of hiding connection failures.
- Preserve proxy bypass rules, signed manifest verification and package integrity checks throughout redirected downloads.

## v1.5.4

- Generation failures now explain the cause and the next action across canvas nodes, task history and custom channels.
- Distinguish content moderation, account quota, provider billing, invalid parameters, rate limits, uncertain submissions and failed result downloads without guessing refunds or the offending input.
- Preserve safe error codes and request identifiers for support, including business errors returned with HTTP 200 and JSON errors inside media downloads.
- Prevent unsafe unchanged batch retries; edited prompts and reference media can be submitted as new attempts after moderation failures.
- Cover all 42 currently declared BeefAPI error codes with a shared frontend and backend regression contract.
- Improved the shared model picker with a viewport-safe, internally scrollable layout and consistent single-line model options.
- Removed redundant model icons, secondary descriptions, and stale option backgrounds from model selection UI.
- Restored native right-click paste behavior in canvas prompt editors and added regression coverage.
- Added regression coverage for generation output delivery, model picker overflow, and local generation error handling.
- Added a canonical local app update script to keep one installed BeefTV application instead of accumulating duplicate builds.

## v1.5.3

- Desktop builds show the installed version in the sidebar and check for published updates on startup.
- Signed updates can be downloaded in the app, then installed with an explicit restart while keeping local projects, assets, settings and connections.
- Pending canvas, director and timeline saves are checked before restarting; failed downloads or verification leave the current installation intact.
- Maintainers can build and publish signed macOS and Windows update packages from main. Existing installations need one manual upgrade to this version before in-app updates are available.

## v1.5.2

- Improved canvas node rendering and inline image cropping, annotation, and local redraw interactions.
- Rebuilt the recycle bin with a fixed two-row viewport, selection, recovery, and confirmed permanent deletion.
- Fixed project cover selection across media nodes and canvases, including fallbacks and centered empty placeholders.
- Added a short product demo and updated the README branding.

## v1.5.1

- Initial public BeefTV snapshot.
- Local-first AI video workspace with image, video, audio, text, asset, canvas, and model-channel workflows.
- BeefAPI remains a built-in local channel while its model catalog is discovered dynamically.
